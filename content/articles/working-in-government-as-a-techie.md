I'm a programmer, developer, data analyst, etc. (really, whatever you want to call me) for a small government agency, the Nevada Department of Wildlife (NDOW). The range of tasks I may work on any given week includes: helping not-technical staff with Excel, querying our vendor database for license holders, writing one off scripts to automate tasks, the occasional data or GIS analysis, or building APIs and web applications. The variety is invigorating. The pay... well, you don't do it for the money. 

While doom scrolling Twitter I often feel left out of the current "talent migration" in tech. People are moving from one company to another, reaping the benefits of a new team, remote work, and a better salary. Good for you, I applaud every single one of you. I FOMO hard, sometimes. But, JOMO! There is a reason I work for NDOW, and I truly love it.

## The Joy of Tech in Government

Many government agencies might be underselling how technologically they are behind. You've probably read the [stories of outdated technology bringing government agencies to it's knees](https://www.marketplace.org/shows/marketplace-tech/its-complicated-updating-old-government-technology/). And wildlife as a field is generally even further behind!

Most of the time, for us, it is due to money. The agencies mission is to manage and protect the wildlife resources of the state for all. For years we've done that without much concern for the "IT technology" we use. Excel spreadsheets and Access databases served us just fine. Some of our remote field offices aren't even networked to headquarters office. 

*I'll note that the one exception to the dated technology is GPS telemetry device we use to monitor animal movement. This is a fascinating topic, one of my favorite! We use cutting edge telemetry devices that allow us to communicate back and forth to change geolocation fix rates, geofences, etc.*

When I first started at NDOW in 2013 my job was to design an Access database to manage critical wildlife health data. Don't get me wrong, Access is better than Excel for this kind of thing. But it was far from the best decision. Had I known more I would have made a different decision. Currently the wildlife health data is stored in a SQLite database that uses a batch automation script to upload data from Excel files. Yes, Excel still is an important tool for us.

## The Universities That Feed Us

Wildlife as field and the pedagogy that feeds wildlife agencies doesn't value technology. I graduated from in 2012 from the University of Nevada with a degree in Wildlife Ecology and Management. Not once did I have a course on GIS, programming, or data management. Obviously university students have a lot of leeway in selecting courses, however, the curriculum was (is?) highly tailored to feeding wildlife agencies. Often by professors that have never worked at a wildlife agency. 

There is a lot to learn in this field. Organismal biology, ecology, evolution, biogeography, methods to analyze ecological data, etc. And all these courses are requried, and valued, at wildlife agencies. However, some of the skill we truly value at an agency are data management, data wrangling, project management, data communication, etc. We work with long term, terrible managed datasets. And many of the early career professionals we hire don't know how to work within the confines of Excel or Access.

The situation is improving. Over the last several years UNR has started teaching R in most of the upper-level undergraduate courses. I've even helped teach several bootcamps at UNR aimed at increasing the tech literacy.

## Talent Acquisition and Retention

It is really hard to hire IT talent at a starting salary around $50,000. Technically NDOW only has 4 IT employees to serve an agency of 253 people. 1 IT Professional, 2 IT Technicians, and 1 newly created IT Professional that is classified as a "programmer". In the last 4 years there has been a complete turnover in the IT staff!
